In summary, this website is a small project of mine which will have a bunch of random information I deem fun enough to have on here.

In the [Works](../works) part of the website, I have a list of all of the projects I've been involved with throughout my time as a programmer. I also included my discography on that page, just for fun.

In the [Posts](../posts) part of the website, I'll be writing blog posts about whatever I feel like. I wouldn't expect posts too often, but I'll try my best to make each one an interesting read.

If you're interested in learning how I made this website, the [Source](https://github.com/Nightkingale/Personal-Website) link in the navigation bar will take you to its GitHub repository. You can also click the [Discord](https://discord.gg/mYjeaZQ) link to join my server, Nightkingale Studios. It's probably the best way to reach me.

## Introduction

A lot of people know me for my work in the video-game modding scene. In particular, I'm probably most notable for my former presense in the [Nintendo Homebrew](https://discord.gg/C29hYvh) server (which I wrote a song about) or as a team member of the [ForTheUsers](https://fortheusers.org/) organization.

I've actually always been interested in computers from a very young age. I enjoyed video-games, and just like everyone else nowadays, I rely on technology for my day-to-day duties. All in all, I'd argue that my life has always revolved around computers.

When the coronavirus pandemic hit back in 2020, like everyone else, my life was changed.

I began to pick up programming as a hobby during lockdown. I taught myself the basics of Python, and even today I'm continuing to refine those skills throughout my work.

I also became interested in tinkering with video-game consoles, primarily the Nintendo Wii U. I spent a lot of time learning how the console worked, and I would teach others online through Discord how to modify their own consoles. I used to even be a writer for the holy bible of Wii U modding, the [Wii U hacking guide](https://wiiu.hacks.guide)!

Nintendo obviously doesn't intend for people to mod their consoles, but I only see it as an advantage to rebel against them. They don't really listen to us anyway...

Along my journey though, I met great friends who still support me today, like [GaryOderNichts](https://github.com/GaryOderNichts), [Lazr1026](https://github.com/Lazr1026), and [NicoAICP](https://github.com/NicoAICP). I also have a Discord server filled with even more amazing people, and I'm so happy to have met each and every one of them.

## Current Work

Nowadays, I don't really involve myself in the homebrew scene as much as I used to. A lot of people know me for maintaining the [Homebrew App Store](https://github.com/fortheusers/hb-appstore) still, and a few core homebrew projects, but outside of a bit of experimentation with the Wii U and Wii sometimes, that's largely it for me anymore.

I am currently pursuing a degree in computer information systems (with a concentration of cyber security) at Central New Mexico Community College. I was actually really inspired by the homebrew scene (and especially my friend, Gary) to go this path.

On the side, I'm a meme rapper (if you couldn't tell yet) and a school teacher, which is definitely an interesting mix of things to be. I couldn't ask for a better life though!
