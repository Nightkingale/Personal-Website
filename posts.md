### Fun Facts

* I like dinosaurs and birds. Dinosaurs are great, birds are great. I'm very sure Saint Mercat√∏r would agree with me. He's smart and musically talented, just like me.

* In my spare time, I like going for walks, making or listening to music, doodling random stuff, playing video games, and taking naps. I touch grass, I promise!

* I know how to play guitar, so I'm actually cultured in music, despite what I've published online. My meme raps are all a result of random satire I've written.

* I have collected way too much video game stuff. I have over 100 amiibo figures, 15 different consoles, and more video games than I could possibly count. Send help.

* He will deny it, but GaryOderNichts is responsible for my meme raps. :)
